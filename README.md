# Advent of Gopilot

Solutions to Advent of Code 2016 in Go using only GitHub Copilot.

### "Rules"

The idea is to have GitHub Copilot generate all the actual code. This means the only way I have to solve the problem is by writing comments. The only actual code I allow myself to write is `package main` and `}` in the case of unclosed blocks. I also allow myself to copy and move code within the repository. 

#### Why Go?

Because I don't know Go.

#### But you won't learn Go this way

That is not the goal. The goal is to test out GitHub Copilot.

#### Why AoC 2016?

Because I hadn't done any of it before. 2018 is considered hard, so it was either 2016 or 2017.

#### The code is ugly

That's on GitHub Copilot.
