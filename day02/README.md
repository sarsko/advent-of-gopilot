## Day 2

Wow! I should have recorded part 1, because that went fast!

I didn't have to write much more than
```
// if char is U
    // if position is not 1, 2 or 3
        // decrease position by 3
```
and then keep on pressing <kbd>Tab</kbd> for part 1.

My guess is that a decent amount of people have done part 1 in that way and pushed it to GitHub, but still, that was much faster than I would have been.

Part two was a bit more cumbersome. It understood the "L", "R", "D", "U" pattern, but the rest had to be commented. Would have been faster and prettier to do it myself.

To run:
```
go run .
```
First 5 lines are the solution to part one and the last 5 lines are the solution to part two. Converting to hex has to be done manually.
